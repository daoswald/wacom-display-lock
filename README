wacomlock - Utility for locking Wacom tablet to an xserv display (GNU/Linux)

SYNOPSIS

    wacomlock [--help|-h] [DISPLAY ID]

    wacomlock # If no DISPLAY ID is passed, the user is prompted.

DESCRIPTION

The Gnome Settings panel for locking a Wacom tablet to a specific display is buggy, and
mistakenly locks only the tablet, not the pen device as well. At least for the Wacom 6100 M,
it is necessary to lock the pen device too, or the setting has no effect.

This utility will detect connected displays, list them, and then prompt the user to choose
one to lock the tablet to. The lock can be switched to a different display at any time, and
the lock only persists for the current login session; on reboot the tablet will reset to
its normal operating mode.

A future version of this script will allow for unsetting the lock.

This script is written in Perl, and has no external dependencies aside from the
xrandr and xsetwacom executables, and a Perl distribution itself (any version from
5.10 onward is fine).
